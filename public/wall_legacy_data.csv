But you dream of some epiphany

Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs  
Time, mystical time  
Cutting me open, then healing me fine  
Time, wondrous time  
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies

Cursing my name, wishing I stayed  
You turned into your worst fears  
Tossing out blame, drunk on this pain  
Crossing out the good years  
Cursing me name, wishing I stayed

And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now

Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?

And how it glistened as it fell  
I remember it all too well

How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?  
When you can’t blame it on my youth  
Lord, what will become of me

And someone else lights up the room?  
People love an ingénue  
How can a person know everything at eighteen  
But nothing at twenty-two?  
And will you still want me when I’m nothing new?  
— Nothing New  
  
  
Too young to know it gets better  
I’ll be summer sun for you forever  
Forever winter if you go

Checkmate, I couldn’t lose

I miss you, but I miss sparkling

You know how much I hate that everybody just expects me to bounce back,   
just like that

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes  
I gave my blood, sweat and tears for this  
I hosted parties and starved my body  
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss

The jokes weren't funny, I took the money  
My friends from home don't know what to say  
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown  
And I saw something they can't take away  

'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned  
Everything you lose is a step you take   
So make the friendship bracelets  
Take the moment and taste it  
You've got no reason to be afraid  

You're on your own, kid  
Yeah, you can face this  
You're on your own, kid  
You always have been  

So I wander through these nights  
I prefer hiding in plain sight  
My fourth drink in my hand  
These desperate prayers of a cursed man  
Spilling out to you for free  
But darling, darling, please  
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking  
If you knew where I was walking  
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
